This program transforms texts from the Latin script to Tengwar, more specifically the Ã“matehtar mode of Quenya.
It tries to automatically choose the most aesthetically pleasing Tengwa and Tehta variants and positions.

Various output fonts and formats, including the common ISO 8859-1 encoding, are supported.
Additionally, Arabic decimals are properly mapped to the Eldar's duodecimal notation.
