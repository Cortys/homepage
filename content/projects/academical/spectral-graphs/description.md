A short introductory paper to spectral graph theory and a graph coarsening approach described by [Loukas et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07510;blank).
It describes how coarsening affects the spectrum of a graph via the notion of *restricted spectral similarity*.
This similarity measure compares graphs by the distance between their Laplacian's eigenvalues.
The measure is used to show that the spectral distortion introduced by coarsening is smallest for regular graphs.
